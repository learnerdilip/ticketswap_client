This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is the client for a tticket swap app which is a platform for selling and buying tickets. 

### USER STORIES(As a User):
- I can visit the website to see the events and the tickets on offer
- i can see the comments made for each ticket
- I need to sign in to create an event
- I need to signup to be able to sign in
- I can add tickets to an existing event or add a ticket
- I can edit a ticket 
- I see the risk of buying a ticket
- the RISK is calculated based on factors BELOW
- I can add comments as a logged in user

#### RISK CALCULATION:
- if the ticket is created in working hours (0900 HRS -1700 HRS) the risk is less
- if the ticket has more than 3 comments the risk is more (it can be fake!)
- if the ticket is the ONLY ticket of the user the risk is more
